        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What puts the “wonder” in “<strong>wonderburger</strong>,” you ask? It’s all in the texture! To achieve crispy, craggy edges, we form ground beef into balls, then press down in a hot pan with a spatula to create super-thin patties. In the last few minutes of cooking, we top them with gooey white cheddar, then sandwich each between a potato bun with caramelized onion. A homemade special sauce is perfect for pairing with the <em>Old Bay fries</em> on the side—and will elicit major “oohs” and “ahhs” from your dining companions.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
            <li>OLD BAY Seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of Ketchup</li>
            <li>10 ounces of Ground Beef</li>
            <li>2 Potato Buns</li>
            <li>12 ounces of Yukon Gold Potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Dijon Mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of White Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.<p></p></li>
            <li>• Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and half the OLD BAY® Seasoning (you’ll use more later). Season lightly with salt and pepper. TIP: No need to season generously— there’s already salt and pepper in the seasoning! • Roast on top rack until browned and crispy, 20-25 minutes.<p></p></li>
            <li>• While potatoes roast, heat a large drizzle of oil in a medium, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 8-10 minutes. • Add 1 tsp sugar and a splash of water; cook until onion is caramelized and jammy, 2-3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. • Turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl.<p></p></li>
            <li>• Meanwhile, in a second small bowl, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and as much remaining OLD BAY® Seasoning as you like. Set aside. • Form beef* into two equal-sized balls; season all over with salt and pepper.<p></p></li>
            <li>• Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for onion over medium-high heat. Once pan is hot, add beef. Firmly flatten each ball with a spatula to create very thin patties. (TIP: Do so carefully; oil may splatter a bit.) Cook to desired doneness, 3-4 minutes per side. (Don’t worry if the patties aren’t perfectly round—those irregular edges will turn crispy.) • In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top patties with cheddar; cover until cheese melts. Remove from heat.<p></p></li>
            <li>• While patties cook, halve and toast buns. • Divide buns between plates and fill with patties, caramelized onion, and half the special sauce. Serve Old Bay fries on the side with remaining special sauce for dipping.<p></p></li>
        </ol>
